Backend api for spotify playlist saver app

## How to run locally

 * Build jar file with maven from base directory
 `mvn clean package`
 
 * Edit Dockerfile to the following
 `
 	FROM openjdk:15-jdk-alpine
	RUN addgroup -S spring && adduser -S spring -G spring
	USER spring:spring
	ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
	COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
	COPY credentials credentials
	ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Dspring.profiles.active=dev","-jar","/app.jar"]

Also make sure permissions on credentials are set to read so it is able to copy with command
`chmod 444 credentials`
